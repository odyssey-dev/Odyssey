## What is Odyssey? 🧭

In short, an app designed to help start your very own *Odyssey.*

When you're using Odyssey, you will go from place to place, and as you do you'll earn badges, badges for visiting new locations, for visiting whole counties, countries or continents.

Badges mean points. Try to get more than your friends and share the ones you're most proud of.
